// definition: the queue service, the worker and every producer share exactly
// one State type, so the vocabulary cannot drift across the wire. The internal
// names below stay for readability at the storage layer.
//
// StateCancelled marks a job a producer cancelled before it reached a
// terminal state. Cancelled is terminal: the job is never claimable again and
// lease expiry never requeues it, so a cancelled job can never trigger a new
// Chronon render across lease/claim cycles. An in-flight render that was
// already claimed when the cancel landed finishes its GPU invocation (it
// cannot be preempted), but its complete/fail reports are rejected and no
// further invocation ever starts.
//
// StateRendered marks a job whose render is finished and durably stored in the
// artifact store, but whose external publication (e.g. Google Drive) failed. A
// worker re-claiming it must skip rendering and only retry the publication
// step.
