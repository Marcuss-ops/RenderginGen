-- Assembly certification audit — RenderingGen Postgres store (render_artifacts).
--
-- render_artifacts is the DURABLE certification store for assembly-eligible
-- overlay/clip artifacts (migrations/003_render_artifacts.sql): it holds the
-- copy-gate identity facts (profile_id, codec, codec_profile, closed_gop,
-- first_frame_keyframe, geometry, fps) that VeloxEditing relies on for
-- copy-only assembly without re-decoding.
--
-- This query produces the Postgres HALF of the evidence demanded by the
-- transform_assemble.rs REMOVAL GATE (the skip of the contract_id check for
-- contract-less certifications). The Rust gate accepts a certification when
-- contract_id == 'VELOX_ASSEMBLY_READY_V1' OR stream_signature_sha256 is
-- present; on this store those identities surface through
-- profile_id = 'velox-h264-copy-v1' + complete stream facts, because the Go
-- bundle that feeds the wire DROPS explicit contract_id /
-- stream_signature_sha256 (queued via RenderingGen pipeline.go; the
-- metadata-decoder in Rust never receives those keys).
--
-- Criterion: every copy_eligible = TRUE row must carry a COMPLETE identity —
-- profile_id plus non-NULL codec/codec_profile/closed_gop/
-- first_frame_keyframe/geometry/fps. Any NULL below keeps the gate LOCKED and
-- names the rows to re-render or backfill.
--
-- The SQLite half lives at refactored/ops/maintenance/audit_assembly_certifications.py.
--
-- Run against the RenderingGen queue database (DSN per RenderingGen/queue README):
--   psql "$RENDERINGGEN_QUEUE_DSN" -f ops/render_artifacts_contract_audit.sql
